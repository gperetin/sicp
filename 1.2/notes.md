# 1.2 Procedures and the Processes They Generate

It's important to learn to visualize the processes generated by various types
of procedures.

A procedure is a pattern for the local evolution of a computational process.
There are 2 types of processes:

* *recursive process* - process that is characterized by a chain of deferred
  operations. Computing this process requires that interpreter keeps track of
  the operations to be performed later on. This process is characterized by
  "grow-and-shrink" execution graph
* *iterative process* - process whose state can be summarized by a fixed
  number of **state variables**, together with a fixed rule that describes how
  the state variables should be updated as the process moves from state to
  state

We shouldn't confuse *recursive process* with *recursive procedure*. For
example, recursive procedure can generate iterative processes. Language that
can execute iterative processes in constant space, even if that process is
described by a recursive procedure, is called *tail-recursive*. Most common
languages can't do that, so they have special constructs like `do`, `for` and
`while` to model iterative processes, not using recursion.

## Tree recursion

Computational process evolves like a tree, for example, for calculating
Fibonacci sequence, to compute `(fib 5)`, we need to compute `(fib 4)` and
`(fib 3)`; this is because `(fib)` calls itself twice each time it is invoked.
